ZholAman: A smartphone app to monitor reckless driving behaviours

## What is the problem?: <a name = "problem"></a>
Road accidents killed 13.5 lakh people globally in 2018. They are the single largest cause of death for those in age group of 15-45. Reckless driving is responsible for 90% of road deaths.

## Our solution: <a name = "solution"></a>
We have developed an application for smartphones ZholAman, which detects careless driving behavior in real time.

## Steps for development: <a name = "steps-for-development"></a>
We decided to use a smartphone because it has various advantages, including cost-effectiveness and wide availability.

I identified the major reckless driving behaviours. These are:
 - Overspeeding
 - Sudden braking
 - Sudden acceleration
 - Sharp turning

ZholAman was coded using Android studio which is based on Java and XML. In DriveSafe:
 - Accelerometer sensor is used to measure acceleration in 3D space. 
 - Haversine formula is applied to calculate distances and speed from GPS coordinates. 
 - The data collected and stored for later analysis.
 - The user interface was integrated with Google Maps API to provide the user with an interactive experience.

ZholAman can be used to monitor reckless driving behaviours with a high accuracy and improve road safety by individuals, fleet operators, insurance companies, and traffic police.
